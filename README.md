# Invisibility-Cloak
- If you are a Harry Potter fan , you would know what an Invisibility Cloak is. Yes! Itâ€™s the cloak that makes Harry Potter invisible. We will make this happen with few line of python code in OpenCV.
- Once you run the code wait for a few seconds, let the webcam capture the background image then you can come inside the frame with your magical Cloak and be invisible ; )
Hurray!! You are a magician now.
